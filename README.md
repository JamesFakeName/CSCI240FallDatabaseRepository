# CSCI240FallDatabaseRepository
Time to find out if I can update this later. I'd like to do a database based on books I've read, including things like the author, the format, and what I thought of them. Because I'm afraid that won't work out however I'm planning to do a movie database of films I've seen instead. Who knows, maybe I'll change it after talking to Jeff.
